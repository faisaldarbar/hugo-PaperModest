# PaperModest

A lightweight, slightly customized fork of the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) Hugo theme — built and tailored for my personal website [faisaldarbar.com](https://faisaldarbar.com).

## 🚧 Status
This theme works as of now, but I actively tweak it for my own needs. It may break without notice.  
**Please use it only if you're comfortable with that.** No support or contributions are expected.

## ✨ Differences from PaperMod
- Slight layout tweaks
- TBA
